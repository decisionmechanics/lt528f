## Advanced Features

### Extensions and Plugins
- **Exploring Extensions**:
	  - JupyterLab can be extended with third-party extensions for additional functionality.
	  - Common extensions include file viewers, theme customisations, and tools for version control.
- **Installing Extensions**:
	  - Use the Extension Manager in JupyterLab to browse and install extensions.
	  - Alternatively, install via command line, e.g., `jupyter labextension install [extension_name]`.
- **Recommended Extensions**:
	  - Examples: JupyterLab Git for version control, JupyterLab TOC for table of contents in notebooks, and Jupyter Widgets for interactive elements.

### Interactive Widgets
- **Using Jupyter Widgets**:
	  - Widgets are interactive elements that enhance user interaction with notebooks.
	  - Commonly used for creating sliders, buttons, and other interactive controls in notebooks.
- **Creating a Simple Widget**:
	  - Example: Use `ipywidgets` to create interactive sliders for real-time data manipulation.
	  - Basic code example: `import ipywidgets as widgets; widgets.IntSlider()`.
- **Integrating Widgets with Code**:
	  - Widgets can be linked to code cells, allowing dynamic updates and visualisations based on user input.

### Collaboration Tools
- **Real-time Collaboration Features**:
	  - JupyterLab supports real-time collaboration allowing multiple users to edit a notebook simultaneously.
	  - This feature requires a shared server setup or cloud-based JupyterLab environments.
- **Using Collaboration Tools**:
	  - Share a notebook with peers and work on it together in real-time.
	  - Changes made by collaborators are visible instantaneously.
- **Version Control Integration**:
	  - For asynchronous collaboration, integrating JupyterLab with version control systems like Git is beneficial.
	  - Track changes, revert to previous versions, and manage branches directly from JupyterLab.
