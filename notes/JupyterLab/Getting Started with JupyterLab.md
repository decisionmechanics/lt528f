	  - Click on the '+' icon in the File Browser or select 'File' \> 'New' \> 'Notebook' from the Menu Bar.
	  - A dialog box will appear prompting you to select the kernel (e.g., Python, R, Julia). Choose the kernel based on the programming language you intend to use.

#### Naming and Organising
- **Renaming a Notebook**:
	  - Right-click on the notebook's tab and select 'Rename', or click on the notebook's name in the file browser.
	  - Enter the desired name and press 'Enter'. It's good practice to use a clear and descriptive name.
- **Organising Notebooks**:
	  - You can create folders in the File Browser to organise your notebooks.
	  - Drag and drop notebooks into folders to keep your workspace tidy.

#### Basic Operations in a Notebook
- **Entering and Running Cells**:
	  - Click on a cell to enter the edit mode. Type your code or Markdown text.
	  - To run a code cell, press 'Shift + Enter', or click the 'Run' button in the toolbar.
- **Adding New Cells**:
	  - Click the '+' button in the notebook toolbar to add a new cell.
	  - By default, a new cell is a code cell. You can change it to a Markdown cell by selecting 'Markdown' from the drop-down menu in the toolbar.
- **Using Markdown**:
	  - Markdown cells allow you to add formatted text, lists, links, and images to make your notebook more readable.
	  - Common Markdown syntax includes `#` for headers, `*` for bullet points, and `**` for bold text.
- **Saving the Notebook**:
	  - Save your work frequently by clicking the 'Save' icon in the toolbar or by pressing 'Ctrl + S' (or 'Cmd + S' on macOS).
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
	  - JupyterLab supports numerous keyboard shortcuts for faster navigation and editing. For example, 'A' to insert a cell above, 'B' for below, and 'D, D' (press D twice) to delete a cell.
	  - Access the full list of shortcuts from 'Help' \> 'Keyboard Shortcuts' in the Menu Bar.
