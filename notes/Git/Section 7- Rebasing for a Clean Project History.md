## Section 7: Rebasing for a Clean Project History

### What is Rebasing and Why Use It?
- **Rebasing**: A process in Git that integrates changes from one branch into another. It's an alternative to merging.
- **Purpose**: Rebasing is used to maintain a linear project history by moving a feature branch to the tip of the main branch.

### Rebasing vs. Merging
- **Rebasing**: Rewrites history by placing commits from one branch onto the end of another branch, creating a linear sequence of commits.
- **Merging**: Combines the histories of two branches without altering existing commits, leading to a branching history.

### Performing a Rebase: `git rebase`
- **Basic Rebasing**: Use `git rebase [base-branch]` while on the feature branch to rebase it onto the base branch.
- **Interactive Rebasing**: Use `git rebase -i [base-branch]` for more control over the rebasing process, like squashing commits or reordering them.

### Resolving Conflicts during Rebasing
- **Conflict Resolution**: Similar to merge conflicts, rebase conflicts must be resolved manually before the rebase can continue.
- **Continuing a Rebase**: After resolving conflicts, use `git rebase --continue` to proceed with the rebase.

### Best Practices and Cautions
- **Avoid Rebasing Public History**: Rebasing should not be done on branches that are public and shared with others, as it rewrites history.
- **Use for Cleaning Up Local History**: Ideal for cleaning up and organising local commits before integrating them into a shared branch.
- **Test Before Pushing**: After a rebase, thoroughly test your project to ensure no issues were introduced during the rebase.

### Tips for Data Scientists
- **Maintain Clean History**: Use rebase to maintain a clean, linear history for easier tracking and reviewing of data analysis changes.
- **Experimentation Branches**: Rebase branches for experimental analysis onto the main branch once the experiment is complete and you're ready to integrate the changes.
- **Documentation**: Keep detailed notes on the changes made in each commit to aid in conflict resolution during rebasing.
