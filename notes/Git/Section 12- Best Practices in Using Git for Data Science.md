## Section 12: Best Practices in Using Git for Data Science

### Versioning Data and Code Separately
- **Data and Code Repositories**: Maintain separate repositories or branches for data and code to manage changes independently.
- **Data Versioning Tools**: Consider using tools like DVC (Data Version Control) for handling large datasets.

### Handling Large Data Sets (Overview)
- **Git Limitations**: Git is not optimised for large files or binary data, which can lead to performance issues.
- **Git Large File Storage (LFS)**: Use Git LFS to manage and version large files within Git repositories efficiently.
- **External Storage**: Store large datasets in external data storage solutions and reference them in your Git repository.

### Maintaining Readable and Efficient Data Analysis History
- **Descriptive Commit Messages**: Write clear and descriptive commit messages that explain the "why" behind changes.
- **Atomic Commits**: Make small, single-purpose commits for easy tracking and reverting, if necessary.
- **Branching for Separate Analysis**: Use branches for different analyses or experiments, merging them back only when they're finalised and reviewed.

### Collaboration and Code Review
- **Regular Pull Requests**: Use pull requests to review code changes and ensure that new code fits well with the existing codebase.
- **Peer Reviews**: Actively participate in peer reviews to share knowledge and improve code quality.

### Documentation and Commenting
- **In-Code Documentation**: Document your code with comments to make it understandable to others (and your future self).
- **Readme Files**: Keep your repository's README updated with project information, setup instructions, and other relevant details.

### Continuous Learning and Improvement
- **Stay Updated**: Keep up with the latest developments in Git and data science best practices.
- **Feedback and Adaptation**: Be open to feedback from peers and continuously adapt your practices for better efficiency and collaboration.

### Tips for Data Scientists
- **Reproducibility**: Prioritise reproducibility by versioning not only code but also data and environment details.
- **Experiment Tracking**: Use Git branches and tags to track different stages of experiments and analysis.
- **Regular Backups**: Ensure regular backups of critical data, especially when dealing with irreplaceable datasets.
